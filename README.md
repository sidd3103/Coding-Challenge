Follow Up Question : If I had a bit more time, I'd really focus on making the app even better for users. One thing I'd do is make sure that if something goes wrong, users get a helpful message instead of just an error. I'd also add more ways for users to interact with the data, like sorting or filtering, to make it easier to find what they're looking for.

In terms of looks, I'd try to make it work well on all kinds of devices, so whether you're on a big screen or a phone, it's still easy to use. And you know, I'd probably make it a bit prettier too!

Under the hood, I'd dig into how the app talks to the server to see if there's a way to make it faster. Maybe even add a trick or two to remember some data so you don't have to wait for it again.

Lastly, I'd want to be really sure everything works as it should, so I'd spend some time testing it out in different situations. Overall, with a bit more time, I'd aim to make the app more user-friendly, good-looking, and reliable for everyone using it. \ \

Note : The coding exercise asked us to fetch the data from the given endpoints but I couldn't do it due to CORS so I just downloaded the data as local json files and worked with that.
